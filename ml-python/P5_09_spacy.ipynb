I always need to traverse the tree in the same order, hence I moved the logic which determines which child to visit next, into the base class . The individual visitors perform specific operations on the tree nodes and then call the  method in the base . This works pretty well so far. In some cases it is needed to perform actions implemented among multiple visitors (e.g., , ) on one tree. The naive way is to just execute the visitors sequentially. However, this requires traversing the tree multiple times which is inefficient.  Of course, I could also create a new visitor (e.g., ) which just calls the other two visitors—but I think that's not clean code and not flexible.

       " (\"Reading the JAVA 13 SE specification, I found in chapter 5, section 5.1.7. Boxing Conversion the following guarantee: If the value p being boxed is the result of evaluating a constant   expression (§15.28) of type boolean, char, short, int, or long, and   the result is true, false, a character in the range '\\\\u0000' to   '\\\\u007f' inclusive, or an integer in the range -128 to 127 inclusive,   then let a and b be the results of any two boxing conversions of p. It   is always the case that a == b I find it odd that values of type byte are left out from that wording. For example, in a code such as: We have a constant expression of type byte, and after the boxing, the values of b1 and b2 may or may not be the same object. It works actually the same way without the cast: Here, we have a constant expression of type int in an assignment context. So, according to the spec A narrowing primitive conversion followed by a boxing conversion may   be used if the variable is of type Byte, Short, or Character, and the   value of the constant expression is representable in the type byte,   short, or char respectively. So the expression will be converted to byte, and that byte type value will be boxed, so there is no guarantee that the value is interned. My question is am I right in interpreting the spec, or am I missing something? I have looked if the spec requires using of method Byte.valueOf() for the boxing (for which it would be guaranteed), but it does not.\",\n",

       " (\"Happy New Year, everyone! I'm having an issue with transforming implicit missing data into explicit missing data. I am summarizing the number of observations of birds at specific survey sites. These sites were surveyed once a month for 12 months. Unfortunately, the collected data only contains information on actual observations of birds rather than also recording that no birds were observed at a site. When I attempt to add in the missing data extra observations are being added to the data.  My solution is to use complete() to fill in the missing data (i.e., the site/month surveys were no birds were observed). I am able to fill in the missing sites with no issues. However, when I try and fill in the missing months that's when the extra observations are being added to sites that did, in fact, record an observation of a bird. Specifically, the additional observations are being added to station 9 for March (1 -> 2 birds) and April (1 -> 2 birds) resulting in 32 total birds observed rather than 30 birds. Below is an example dataset, and the code that I'm using. I have marked where in the code I am having the issue. I'm brand new to the tidyverse so if you have any general pieces of advice on how to improve my code, I'm all ears. Thanks in advance for your help. I've also included a phot of the correct number of observations just in case.\",\n",

Currently I have the problem that the calculated normalized device coordinates are wrong when I calculate them on the shader, but when I calculate them on the cpu I get the desired results. I have created an Orthographic Projection matrix using the following formula: Where right = 1280, left = 0, top = 0, bottom = 720, zFar = 1.0 and zNear = -1.0. So if I would create a rectangle using the following vertex positions: It should result in a rectangle filling the entire screen. To calculate the normalized device coordinates I use the following formula: In the vertex shader it looks like this: u_ViewProjection is the above mentioned ViewProjection matrix, u_Transform is a transform matrix and is in this case a simple Identity matrix and a_Position is the vertex position. Using the above values it results in the following render: Now if I do the calculation on the cpu using the following code: the transform is the same transform passed to u_Transform and the same for camera.getViewProjectionMatrix that is passed to u_ViewProjection. Here I get the desired result: x = -1.0, y = 1.0 which should be the top left corner of the screen. So my question... Am I doing something wrong in the shader or could it be something else causing this? Edit 1 As said in the accepted answer the Projection matrix needed to be transposed, I came to this matrix by using the following source: https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/perspective-and-orthographic-projection-matrix/orthographic-projection-matrix.

       " (\"I am making a program in javascript that will change the css style (in this case background color) of an element after some delay, similar to a traffic light. The problem is this: when you click the button, the button's onclick listener function is entered. In the function are for loops to iterate through each cell and change its color. Each pass through the loop should update one of the cells colors, but does not. What actually happens is all the cells are updated after the button's onclick listener function is finished. Here is a link to a shortened version of my problem that I made https://jsfiddle.net/lilweege/4291vjto/6/ This is also the case when adding an element, changing some other property such as innerHTML, or some other change in the DOM. Also I don't suspect my 'sleep' function to be the problem, because all it is doing is halting the entire program in the browser until an amount of milliseconds have passed (it calls Date.now() until the delta of current time and start time is larger than the passed in amount). Any pointers or solutions would be much appreciated, thanks!\",\n",

Specifically, I want to globally make sure that middle-button clicks are ignored by all React  handlers. The goal is to work around a 12-year-old WebKit bug where Safari emits a  event when the middle mouse button is pressed, instead of the  event that's mandated by the W3C standard and that's emitted by Chrome and Firefox.  Because some users accidentally trigger middle button clicks while scrolling with the mousewheel, I'd like to ignore these accidental clicks globally.  How? The code I want to inject is very simple:  But I'm not sure where to inject it so that it will run before all event handlers in my app.  One potential complication is that I don't want to ignore middle clicks completely (because browsers have a default behavior that middle clicking on an  element will open the link in a new tab). Instead, I just want to prevent react from doing anything with those invalid  events.\",\n",

You can use this value to: • Manage subscribers in your account   database. Store the , , and    for each transaction, as a best practice to store   transaction records for each customer.

With that noted, my question is: when is the  the same value as the validated receipt's , or when isn't it? In our app we only work with consumable in-app purchases, no subscriptions. In this scenario, are these two values the same? I ask because I need to be able to record the purchase server-side along with information about the user who purchased it. See below for an explanation of the process and problem it presents. Let’s say a user purchases a consumable product and the request to record that transaction fails because our server is down for example, so we do not call . Now let’s say that person logs out and logs into a different user account and purchases another consumable product and again we fail to record it. There are now two consumable products in the receipt. When they launch the app next  is called with two items in the  array to inform us there’s  transactions we need to finish. We need to submit the receipt to our server to record the transactions but we also need to send some additional info along with each transaction such as the user id who purchased it. This means I need to persist this info on disk with an associated  so I can get that data later. I can send an array of user ids and the receipt to the server. But how would the backend know which transaction in the receipt matches which user id in the array? I don’t believe the  array is guaranteed to be sorted in any particular way and may not match the order of the  array provided to . So when there’s multiple transactions to be recorded, how can we properly link them so the purchase is applied to the correct user account server-side? In this scenario, is the  available in-app guaranteed to be the same as the  in the validated receipt?\",\n",

This analysis is called default argument instantiation. The instantiated default argument is then used as the argument of f UPDATE: The problem can be further simplified: The gcc complier will print .

In line 8  just makes the lower 3 bits all ones, and line 9 truncates these 3 ones, and in line 10  makes the result shift left by 3 bits.

My code structure is this: BaseManager.class which is implemented as Singleton and using BaseManager.getInstance() will return single instance in application. Also, when first initialized it automatically creates SmallerAndCompletelyDifferentManager.class - has a dependency. SmallerAndCompletelyDifferentManager.class - creates a Runnable that runs every 2 seconds. Now, I've two scenerios: SCENERIO A: I create initialize BaseManager.class in Activity first and use it wherever I need. The Runnable that is inside SmallerAndCompletelyDifferentManager.class runs okay, but as I understand is attached to Activity - if Activity dies, so will the Runnable which I can not afford. SCENERIO B: I create a foreground service and initialize BaseManager.class. Does this mean that now the Runnable will work as intended - even if application is in background and Activity has been destroyed? Am I getting this right or no?

       " ('My understanding of the memory structure under C is a program\\'s memory is split with the stack and the heap each growing from either end of the block conceivably allocating all of ram but obviously abstracted to some kind of OS memory fragment manager thing. Stack designed for handling local variables (automatic storage) and heap for memory allocation (dynamic storage). (Editor\\'s note: there are C implementations where automatic storage doesn\\'t use a \"call stack\", but this question assumes a normal modern C implementation on a normal CPU where locals do use the callstack if they can\\'t just live in registers.) Say I want to implement a stack data structure for some data parsing algorithm.  Its lifetime and scope is limited to one function. I can think of 3 ways to do such a thing, yet none of them seem to me as the cleanest way to go about this given the scenario. My first though is to construct a stack in the heap, like C++ : This method is alright but it\\'s wasteful in that the stack size is a guess and at any moment  could call some internal malloc or realloc and cause irregular slowdowns.  None of which are problems for this algorithm, but this construct seems better suited for applications in which a stack has to be maintained across multiple contexts.  That isn\\'t the case here; the stack is private to this function and is deleted before exit, just like automatic storage class. My next thought is recursion. Because recursion uses the builtin stack  this seems closer to what I want. This method saves me from writing and maintaining a stack. The code, to me, seems harder to follow, not that it matters to me. My main issue with it is this is using way more space. With stack frames holding copies of this  construct (which basically contains the  plus the actual bits wanted to be held in the stack) and unnecessary copies of the exact same iterator pointer in every frame: because it\\'s \"safer\" then referencing some static global (and I don\\'t know how to not do it this way). This wouldn\\'t be a problem if the compiler did some clever tail recursion like thing but I don\\'t know if I like crossing my fingers and hope my compiler is awesome. The third way I can think of involves some kind of dynamic array thing that can grow on the stack being the last thing there written using some kind of C thing I don\\'t know about. Or an extern  block. Thinking about this, that\\'s what I\\'m looking for but I don\\'t see my self writing an asm version unless it\\'s dead simple and I don\\'t see that being easier to write or maintain despite it seeming simpler in my head.  And obviously it wouldn\\'t be portable across ISAs. I don\\'t know if I\\'m overlooking some feature or if I need to find another language or if I should rethink my life choices. All could be true... I hope it\\'s just the first one. I\\'m not opposed to using some library.  Is there one, and if so how does it work?  I didn\\'t find anything in my searches. I recently learned about Variable Length Arrays and I don\\'t really understand why they couldn\\'t be leveraged as a way to grow stack reference, but also I can\\'t imagine them working that way.',\n",

The area I want to improve is our update method to be encapsulated in the repository rather than fetching the object in the service layer, manipulating it (in whatever fashion the developer sees fit) and then saving it. The repository update method should internally load the model, call the update method on the object and then save it (or call the AddOrUpdate extension). To do this, I was thinking I could add an abstract method on the base class to enforce the developer to implement the update in the model rather than setting the properties in another layer. So this would make the developer write a model that would like this: But when I implement it in this way, the compiler complains as the it thinks  is the name of T and not the concrete class. I think I'm missing something obvious here, but I just can't see it... Any suggestions would be appreciated.\",\n",

       " (\"Apologies if two days' frustration leaks through... Problem: can't reliably run Tensorboard in jupyter notebook (actually, in Jupyter Lab) with and if I kill the tensorboard process and start again in the notebook it says it is reusing the dead process and port, but the process is dead and netstat -ano | findstr :6006` shows nothing, so the port looks closed too. Question: How in the name of $deity do I get tensorboard to restart from scratch and forget what it thinks it knows about processes, ports etc.? If I could do that I could hack away at residual path etc. issues... Known issues already addressed (I think): need to escape backslashes in Python string to get proper path and other OS gremlins; avoid spaces in path, ensure correct capitalisation... Environment: Win 64-bit Home with Anaconda and Tensforflow-GPU 2 installed via conda install - TF is working and writes data to the specified path given via the call back  But I'm damned if I can start Tensorboard reliably within the notebook. I found that if I started an Anaconda command window and invoked tensorboard from there tensorboard started ok... It was accessibly in Chrome at localhost:6006 as stated (specifically ) (i'll ignore the other problems with tensorboard such as refresh failures on scalars, odd message on graph, etc.) and  then shows tensorboard in the notebook and in the separate chrome tab. However! whilst tensorboard reports in the notebook that it is reusing the old dead PID it is in fact on a completely different new PID What have I been doing wrong, and how do I reset tensorboard completely? PS the last (successful!) invocation was in fact with where makeWindowsCmdPath is defined as  UPDATE 2020-01-03 A MWE of eventual success has been uploaded in a comment at Github in response to an issue that includes the PID referencing errors of tensorboard\",\n",

       " (\"On my website I have a page displaying the list of all products with a search engine built with FilterSet. Everything is working perfectly but I want to add one more search option. I want to be able to filter all products with an attribute set to True, but when the checkbox is not marked I want to dislay all the products. With checkbox, the filtering is working but like I said I want to display all the products when the box isn't marked. I know using checkbox is a bad way to do that because when the checkbox is not marked, it considered the value to be False. So I tried using RadioSelect but nothing is working, in my filter tab I only have the title of the radioselect and a white rectangle below but I can't write on it or do anything with it. So what do I have to use ? Here is my code. The products I want to display are from the model  and the attribute is the attribute  from the model  that is linked to  with a foreign key in . models.py filters.py Thanks in advance !

The idea is to create an app that connects trough BLE with a device that functions like a gateway(OS is linux). The mobile app needs to control the gateway device to make connections(also BLE) with other devices(peripherals). The peripherals have data that is send to the gateway device. The mobile app should be able to read that data and be able to tell the gateway device to send data back. What i could find is that the gateway should connect and disconnect to every device when it wants to send data.   My questions are: - What is the best practice to create something like this? - How stable would this be? - If is make simulated RFCOMM in linux can i have more that 1 connection open?

The IP address range must be from within the   internal IP address ranges (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, and   192.168.0.0/16) and have a block size of 29. Examples of valid Cloud Filestore instance IP address ranges are 10.0.3.0/29 and   172.31.0.0/29. You can assign the IP address range if there's a specific one you want   to use, otherwise Cloud Filestore picks a random range to use from   within the internal IP address ranges. If the range is already in use,   the service tries again until it finds one that is free. If you assign   an IP address range, make sure it doesn't overlap with any existing   subnets in the VPC network that the Cloud Filestore instance uses, or   with the IP address ranges assigned to any other existing Cloud   Filestore instances in that network. /29 means it needs 8 ip addresses. What does it do with all those addresses? I need ONE static IP address for the instance because thats how I will map to its shares: https://cloud.google.com/filestore/docs/accessing-fileshares It looks like I can't choose which address it assigns the instance. Will that address ever change? This behaviour is weird because for most services I would reserver a static internal IP and use that.

I have a solution that I'm currently using in a handful of places that relies on array_agg.

Instead of showing up as in the source file, that cell was being copied as \"#######\". I realized that when I stepped through the code I was sometimes manually resizing the column with the date to fit at breakpoints (to ensure the correct date was in the cell, and it wasn\\'t just a series of # characters). Whenever I did this, it copied the content correctly. So the code is copying the characters that are displayed rather than the content of the cell. Resizing the columns before calling the Sub fixed the behavior.',\n",

       " (\"I have a very simple MPI program: I am running it on a cluster with two nodes. I have a make file and with  command I generate  executable file. I run it with the following command: in second_machinefile I have names of these two nodes. The wierd problem is that, when I run this command from one node, it executes normally, however when I run the command from another node I get error: After trying to tun with GDB I got this backtrace: which to be honest I don't fully understand.  My main confusion is that the program is executed properly from machine_1, it connects to the machine_2 without errors and processes are initialized on both machines. But when I try to execute the same command from machine_2, it is not able to connect machine_1. The program is also running correctly if I run it only on machine_2 as well, when decreasing number of processes so it fits in one machine. Is there anything I am doing wrong? or what could I try to understand better the cause of the problem?\",\n",

Ideally, my y-axis would vary from 10e-10 on the bottom to 10e-2 on the top, and would look similar to this excel plot: In presenting this data, getting to a lower number is better, so I was hoping to represent this with bigger bars, rather than the absence of bars. Inverting the y-axis limits makes the bars start from the top, but it does not solve my problem, since the smaller bars are still associated with the smaller numbers.  Is there some way to move the origin, and specify that bars should be drawn from the origin to the appropriate tick on the axis? The data and code are really not so important here, but here is an excerpt: The resultant plot has bigger bars for bigger numbers and smaller bars for smaller numbers.  I could instead plot the difference between each value and the maximum, but I was hoping there was some built-in way to do this in matplotlib/pyplot.

The only issue I need to overcome is if the user has already been redirected then don't do it for every page... store the fact that the user was redirected and don't do it again until the session has ended. Something like that.  I have written the code below but a) I'm unsure this is the best way to do it and b) it seems to get stuck in a redirect loop (which I thought I'd avoided by my second session check). I'm using the ipapi.com to check the user's location. I’m also using ProcessWire’s ‘$session’ which is effectively the same as PHP session.\",\n",

As suggested in Firebase transaction API call current data is null transaction current value occasionally returns as null. I've made a guard for the null case and returned 0 so the transaction function fires again until it gets the actual credit value. However, in a case where 2 charge functions are fired back to back, the second call will get a current value of 0 (which is probably the returned 0 on the first charge call). So it will prematurely exit assuming that the user doesn't have enough credits. When both functions resolve the final credit value will be 3 and the second charge call will be ignored. Console log output: first call current value: null first call returns 0 second call current value: 0 second call aborts first call current value: 5 first call returns 5 - 3 first call success second call no commit So the second charge call ends up not going through when user had enough credits.

       " (\"On page 551 of the 5th edition, there is the following file, named thismod.py: After which the test is run in the terminal as follows: The use of the local() function makes perfect sense, as python makes a variable var in the local scope of the function local(). However I am lost when it comes to any uses of the global variables. If I make a function as follows: I get an UnboundLocalError when running this function in the terminal. My current understanding is that the function would run, and first search the local scope of thismod.nonglobal, then, being unable to find an assignment to var in nonglobal(), would then search the global scope of the thismod.py file, wherein it would find thismod.var with the value of 99, but it does not. Running  immediately after in the terminal, however, yields the value as expected. Thus I clearly haven't understood what has happened with the  declaration in glob1(). I had expected the above to happen also for the  line in glob2(), but instead this acts only as a local variable (to glob2()?), despite having had the code for glob1() run prior to the assignment. I had also thought that the  line in glob2() would reset var to 99, but this is another thing that caught me off guard; if I comment out this line, the next line fails. In short I haven't a clue what's going on with the global scope/imports here, despite having read this chapter of the book. I felt like I understood the discussion on globals and scope, but this example has shown me I do not. I appreciate any explanation and/or further reading that could help me sort this out. Thanks.\",\n",

I need to replace all outliers (as defined for our purposes as more than 2 SD away from the mean), of each column with NA or NULL. I'm trying to have this iterate across all columns, calculating the outliers for each column and replacing those values. Disclosure: I also know statistically there are strong views on the removal of outliers, and the use of SD as a measure to exclude them given that SD is calculated including the outliers in this case. These were my instructions from our statistician, so I am working off that for now. This is a glimpse of my dataset: I've tried code including the scale() function, but when I performed the below functions I found it replaced values that were within 2 SD of the mean of the column, and it left my code in the scaled format. I'm not as familiar with this function and was not sure how to revert it back to the original data points, even if it was replacing the correct outlier-deemed values. Method attempt #1 Method attempt #2 I know attempt number two does not replace the data with NA.  Any help would be immensely appreciated.\",\n",

Original Post Can't seem to find anywhere else this is done, so happy for any links in comments too :) I have a column of text, the contents of over a hundred files with  at top of each. More than 50,000 characters, so they pasted into a newline each cell ('paste as values'). I can easily tell the row numbers to work with and have a draggable working formula, just can't get it properly ARRAYFORMULA capable, since the input might change by easily a thousand rows so needs to handle that gracefully. Formulas only please, no code Example Spreadsheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yaETa3Pvq47DpcAyojSlf6p5N1Tt_hpvoqp7WEtC6pI/edit?usp=sharing Example Input (50,000+ characters) https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sMl0ZQfbXZUjpB0fic2VkX5Ze5H_IEGL/view?usp=sharing Note - if the input file is removed when I clean my drive up, just copy-paste the sample below till 50,000+ characters, or see linked spreadsheet Input Desired Output Each [task].* is a new file, so seperate by those into one cell each in a single column, with newlines () as internal separators. In other words, everything after [task] till the next [task] (or end of column, if no more [task]) combined into one cell each.  Just has to be arrayformula able and avoid the char limit for functions like concat of 50,000 characters.  Current Output Getting row numbers  is the input column  is dropdown with  selected Then some of my attempts to use these numbers Works, has to be dragged through, and doesn't have any separators. Doesn't work, I kept adding more arrayformula but still just first result Just the string used in previous INDIRECT Doesn't work, has separators but still only looping the first result.  is the string list for indirects (see above) There are some other formulas in the example sheet, I mostly removed the duds as I kept going though. I found lots of interesting resources out there but nothing that seemed to target using row numbers, or even just SPLIT + JOIN type approach that allowed  (AND avoided the 50,000 character limit issue with single CONCAT or similar calls).\",\n",

Then, I used a while loop that iterates until  is greater than or equal to 500: I thought I wrote  and  pretty efficiently, but based on some tests, it seems like this program gets unwieldy very quickly. To compute the first number with over 100 divisors takes less than a second, but to compute the first number with over 150 divisors takes about 8-9 seconds, indicating that it's probably exponential in time? I don't have much experience with computational complexity or writing efficient algorithms but I once saw an example of using dictionaries (memoization I think?) to greatly improve a recursive algorithm to compute the Fibonacci numbers, and I was wondering if a similar idea could be used here. For example, the nth triangle number can be expressed as n(n+1)/2, so without loss of generality it's the product of an odd and even number, say n and (n+1)/2 respectively. If you could store the divisors for each number up to n in a dictionary, then you wouldn't have to redo the computations in , and instead you could just reference the dictionary. The only issue is finding out which divisors between n and (n+1)/2 overlap to get the right number of them. Is this a reasonable line of attack? Or am I missing something here? Additionally, what is the time complexity of my algorithm and how would I calculate it?\",\n",

       " (\"What would be the best application design when there are multiple clients (companies) working with ASP.NET Core application and a separate instance of HttpClient with the corresponding client certificate must be maintained in ASP.NET application for each of these companies? First, some important facts about the application: It's an ASP.NET Core 3.1 application. Each company using this ASP.NET Core application needs first to upload its own client certificate during the registration. Certificate and corresponding password are stored in the database. Certificate is necessary for communication with some external web service which must be notified on behalf of the company that some action was performed by the company in the mentioned ASP.NET Core application. In other words, for some actions company performs in the ASP.NET Core application, some external web service must be notified with POST method and corresponding body and its response must be processed and returned. After registration, company can start sending requests to the mentioned ASP.NET Core application. This ASP.NET Core application should obtain corresponding company certificate from the database, create HttpClient object and add certificate to it, prepare request data and call external web service for notification. Then response from this external web service should be processed and returned as response to the original company request. Of course, there can be simultaneous requests coming from different companies, but there can also be simultaneous requests coming for the same company from different company offices - all requests from the same company use the same company client certificate, but request data (body) to notify external web service will always be different. As far as I know, it's not the best practice to create new HttpClient object for every call to external web service. I have considered HttpClientFactory, but in my case each HttpClient object must contain corresponding client certificate for the company. I know ASP.NET Core supports named HttpClient to maintain separate HttpClient for each company, but AFAIK this named clients can only be created in the Startup class. This won't be sufficient because new company can be registered anytime while ASP.NET app is running, company can upload new certificate while app is running rendering existing named client invalid, etc. I am considering maintaining a static list containing one HttpClient object for each company. When first request for the company is initiated, new HttpClient is created with the corresponding client certificate and added to this list. For all subsequent requests from the same company (or office) the corresponding HttpClient is obtained from the mentioned static list and reused. Of course, I would have to establish some locking on the company's HttpClient instance so that it does not break in case of simultaneous requests from the same company. One concern I have with this design is that there might be couple of hundred companies and this list of http clients can be quite long. Do you have any other idea or proposal?\",\n",

It's quite challenging for me now as I had just started to learn C#, I hope I could find some solutions here to assist me throughout the journey. Thank you in advance! Objectives: Extract data from Excel file which is filled in the first & second column and put them in a nx2 Matrix (where n can be any number of rows, here I set 3000, so it's 3000x2 Matrix) Extract data from the first column of the Matrix to multiply by 5 and store in a vector 1 (VColumn). Similarly, extract data from the second column of the Matrix to multiply by 2 and store in a vector 2 (VRow). With this method I'm able to multiply each column with different values. (Is there any other more direct methods to multiply each column value individually in Matrix form using .Multiply keywords?) From what I see from the output, it is display in a line instead of one column. To place vector 1 and vector 2 into Matrix form (3000x2 Matrix format). But the output I'm getting is 0. Not sure this is the correct way though... how do I code for this part or any other alternatives? I'm not sure if this is the right way to code for Matrix Multiplications. If there are alternative ways, please do share as I'm still learning. Many thanks!\",\n",

I'm making a simple mistake but can't spot it. QUESTION: Although  expects , why does my code only give the expected answer where  (i.e. U and V are the other way around) is used? Incidentally, when plotting, I've shifted the origin of  to  (as discussed here). I think the problem lies somewhere related to my indexing etc. Code below (using python 3.5 and matplotlib v3.x):\",\n",

Clicking on an item in the Listbox calls a Change event which populates other controls\\' values according to which item has been selected. The user may change values within the text boxes. Upon changing them, a \"Saved\" flag gets set to False for that question. The user may then save the question into memory; or navigate away from the question. If the user navigates away without saving (by means of clicking a different item in the Listbox), I want to present them with a warning - giving the option to either abandon their unsaved changes; or to remain with the current selection, and revert the Listbox selection which they just clicked. If \"Abandon changes\" is selected, it works fine. However it runs into trouble when I try to revert the Listbox selection. I use an \"EventsOn\" Boolean to handle when the Change procedure should proceed, to avoid it calling itself. This seems to work, at the correct point in the code. However after EventsOn is reinstated, and after Exit Sub, it seems that the Change event is called again. I do not know why the event is firing again. This results in the user being presented with the option a second time. A lot of the following code has been stripped out because it relates to details of other form controls; loading/saving data from a database; and handling classes and dictionaries. However I have retained the relevant logic of the form controls: Naturally, I have searched for this problem - but there are no answers so far which have assisted me: Listbox events firing strangely - relates to C# and not VBA listbox selected item changed event fired two times - relates to C# and not VBA vba listbox event fires twice - suggests that a SetFocus method of the Listbox could solve the issue. However I have tried this, and the problem remains The logic of my code seems sound. The mystery is why the Change event is being called a second time, even after Exit Sub.',\n",

The stack trace was too short in RSpec output to realize what the issue was, but now it's showing up in regular usage, as well. Update 2 I'm going to go ahead and mark this as solved. It doesn't appear to be an issue with FactoryBot as I initially thought, but rather an issue with my understanding of . When the class name cannot be easily inferred by the association name, you must specify the  option. This became clear after browsing the source code for a bit.

To clarify, take the first row as an example: in the 47th column, the ID A hits a total of 90% of 156 events that he will achieve in 90 days. What I need is: for each row, count the length of the first sequence of 0s that is bigger than 7 (or any arbitrary number predefined). So, for example: for the first row, I want to know how long is the first sequence of zeros after column 47, but only if the sequence exceeds 7 zeros in a row. If there are 6 zeros and then a non-zero, then I don't want to count it. Finally, I want to store this result in a new column after [day_90]. So if ID A has a sequence of 10 zeros right after column 47, I want to add a new column [0_sequence] that holds the value of 10 for that ID. I really have no idea where to start.

I have a table : Each  object has related table : In  we store detailed characteristics of a run, called a . Things such as, voltage, temperature, pressure, etc. For simplicity\\'s sake, let\\'s assume the fields I want to filter on are \"Min. Temperature\" and \"Max. Temperature\". So for example: (RunValue.value are floats, but let\\'s keep it to ints for simplicity). I have two HTML inputs in my page where the user enters min and max (for temperatures). They can both be left blank, or just one, or both, so it\\'s an open ended filter, it can define a range to filter on, or not. For example, if the user were to input: That set of filters should only return Run 1 from the above  instance examples, where the lower threshold is above 400 and the upper threshold is below 500. All other  do not qualify. So then I need to return all  object instances where  matches the filters the user has input. This is what I have tried: Running that yields some results, but not the desired results. It returns Run 1 and Run 4, when it should only return Run 1. The  being from 400 to 500, Run 1 qualifies, but the max temperature of Run 4 is over 500, it should NOT qualify. The filters need to exclude object instances by looking at both ranges at the same time, the minimum AND the maximum. The printed query is as follows: What I think I need to be filtering in pseudo code: . I then thought I should be including the value ranges in the Q queries as a regular Django filter, separated by commas: Same result, so the value range is not the issue there, it\\'s the logic grouping (I think?). So I tried to do two reduce Q queries (a bit gnarly looking), so as to say: (Note all 3  where changed to AND gates) This yielded 0 hits. Using the same compound reduce method for  but changing the outter logic gate for  to OR yields the same wrong results, Run 1 and Run 4: Perhaps I am over complicating myself here and there\\'s something very simple I\\'m not seeing (I\\'ve been trying to solve this logic puzzle for 2 days now, getting a bit of tunnel vision.

With a given list of Strings The Time is 12H 3M 12S The Time is 3M 12S It is 12H 3M Ready in 12S The Time is 6H I would like to extract into 3 groups H, M and S, somehow like (?: (\\\\d{1,2})H)? (?: (\\\\d{1,2})M)? (?: (\\\\d{1,2})S)? Easyliy I could then access the H, M and S components by group(1-3). I just would like to restrict the match to fulfill the creteria, that at least one of the optionl groups has to be triggered or it's no match.

My task is to display a message above the checkbox when it is unchecked.  I tried simply using the object, however, the component was not re-rendering when the object changed. I found a solution to my problem by simply adding another useState hook (boolean value) that serves as a toggle.

Am I not updating my object in a manner that allows React to see the change in state?  Can someone explain to me what is going on here?

From what I have seen creating another table is not really possible since in those examples they are unique within the newly created table (eg. someone wanted to create a field to store multiple phone numbers for one person within the \"person\" table, so they can create a table of telf.numbers since they are unique and links them back to the \"person\" in question.)

My question is: why ain\\'t I able to create non-blocking code using jax-rs endpoints and leverage standard event-loop thread? EDIT: A couple of question are strugling my mind: Resteasy is not async by default, but it is capable of handling non blocking async response Which is the difference between , and ? From here, I figure out any JAX-RS implementation is able to handle non blocking async response, since  is a JAX-RS annotation, doesn\\'t it? I think this article explains very well what those concepts are meant for. EDIT 2: By other side, according to Quarkus Http documentation, it says: All the HTTP requests your application receive are handled by event loops (IO Thread) and then are routed towards the code that manages the request. Depending on the destination, it can invoke the code managing the request on a worker thread (Servlet, Jax-RS) or use the IO Thread (reactive route). Form here, I figure out that, by default, all JAX-RS \"endpoints\" are handled by a worker thread (worker verticle?) since they are blocking by default. According to vert.x documentation: By default blocking code is executed on the Vert.x worker pool. My questions now are: As we have mentioned before, we are able to make a jax-rs \"endpoint\" non-blocking using an . Is it mandatory to use a worker thread when the jax-rs endpoint in to a blocking code now? a \"quarkus worker thread\" is equivalent to \"vert.x worker verticle\"?',\n",
